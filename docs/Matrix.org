** Description
The main abstract class for the Matrix object. Basically a huge container for an assortment of matrix functions that aren't nessicarily inherent to one type of matrix. For subclasses, see [[Child Classes][here]]

** Fields
- elements: double[][]
- rows: int
- cols: int
- label?

** Methods
*** Basic Matrix Arithmetic
**** public Matrix add (Matrix b)
+ adds matrix b to *this*
+ returns the sum matrix

**** public Matrix addScalar (double s)
+ adds scalar s to *this*
+ returns the sum matrix

*** private static double det (Matrix x)
+ not defined as abstract (because it isn't overridden), but it is abstracted away. This is an algorithm to recursively calculate the determinant of a matrix of dynamic shape.
+ returns the double value of the determinant
+ *o(n!)*, todo optimize this through triangle row reduction

*** public double argmax ()
+ adds scalar s to *this*
+ returns the sum matrix
